# Bug-Catcher

The ultimate bug catcher!

A console-based script that stores all your common and uncommon syntax or logic errors, so you don't have to!

The script collects:
- Date
- OS
- Language
- Application
- Error (code / type)
- Error Message
- Cause
- Solution
- Code Solution (if applicable)
- Tags (comma separated, for search purposes)

through the console and stores the information in a Google Sheet.

This centralises the storage of all your known error and enables efficient searching of these errors.
